# CREDIT-RISK-MODELING
A hilarious journey into Credit Risk Modeling 📊💸 - From raw data to a full-fledged PD, LGD, and EAD system, with a dash of humor and a sprinkle of magic! ✨

🧙‍♂️ The Loan Ranger's Guide to Credit Risk: A (Seriously Fun) Modeling Adventure! 📊💸
Because predicting defaults shouldn't be a defaulting experience! 😉
Welcome, intrepid data explorer, to the most exhilarating credit risk modeling project you'll ever encounter! Forget dusty textbooks and mind-numbing formulas – we're diving headfirst into the world of loans, defaults, and financial wizardry with a healthy dose of humor and some seriously slick code.

Ever wondered what makes a borrower tick (or, more accurately, default)? Or how banks figure out who gets a "yes" and who gets a "not right now, sweetie"? Well, you're about to find out!

🚀 What's Inside This Magical Trunk of Code?
This project isn't just about throwing some data at a model and hoping for the best. Oh no, we're building a full-spectrum credit risk system that would make even the most seasoned financial analyst crack a smile (and maybe offer you a job 😉).

We've got:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The Detective Work 🕵️‍♀️

Unraveling the mysteries of LendingClub's loan data.

Discovering hidden trends (like that ever-increasing number of loans.<img width="1581" height="562" alt="increasing_trend" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ccfb6e80-1dd2-43d9-870c-1e505ad71815" />


Peeking into financial indicators (who knew so many loans were for debt consolidation? <img width="2355" height="1579" alt="financial_indicators" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1765df67-9ad2-41b4-a733-e127d2a33139" />


Unmasking the average default rate (it's about 12%, if you were wondering! <img width="355" height="324" alt="default_rate" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aad9d519-7ae3-4c3f-8720-5fc962b56b9b" />


And understanding how credit grades are like a financial report card, revealing who's naughty and who's nice <img width="2555" height="689" alt="credit_risk_grade" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3aa8b23c-58e7-4934-a4c6-766d2085cf1a" />


Probability of Default (PD) Modeling: Predicting the Future (Sort Of!) 🔮

Building a robust model to predict who's likely to not pay back their loan.

Employing an "Out-of-time Split" strategy to ensure our model is a true time traveler (and not just good at memorizing history!) <img width="1538" height="562" alt="out_of_time_split" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e51d7dd4-da92-44c1-bc4c-492e866d263b" />


Leveraging the power of Weight of Evidence (WoE) and Information Value (IV) to select the most impactful features (because who needs irrelevant gossip when you're predicting defaults?).

And demonstrating how annual income, surprisingly, can tell us a lot about risk <img width="1656" height="587" alt="annual_income_risk" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71c5cf6b-94ef-45c5-bb17-31bb16704921" />


We even have a PD Model Monitoring system because even the best predictions need a watchful eye! 👀

Loss Given Default (LGD) Modeling: How Much Ouch? 🤕

If someone defaults, how much money are we actually losing? This model tells us!

We're not just predicting if they'll default, but how much of a dent it'll leave.

Exposure at Default (EAD) Modeling: The What-If Scenario 🤷‍♀️

Before a loan goes sour, how much of it is actually "exposed" to risk?

This model helps us understand the potential maximum loss.

🧐 Why This Project is Cooler Than the Other Side of the Pillow:
Holistic Approach: We're not just building one model; we're building an entire ecosystem for credit risk assessment. It's like the Avengers of financial modeling!

Real-World Data: We're playing with a real dataset from LendingClub, so you know this isn't just theoretical mumbo jumbo.

Clear & Concise: Even with all the complex stuff, we've kept the notebooks easy to follow, with plenty of comments and visualizations. Because nobody likes getting lost in a labyrinth of code!

Visual Delights: Charts, graphs, and plots galore! We believe in making data beautiful (and understandable). Just check out the images – they tell a story! 🖼️

👩‍💻 How to Get This Party Started (aka Running the Code):
Clone this repo:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
Navigate to the project directory:

Bash

cd your-repo-name

Bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the dependencies:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt # (You'll need to create this file based on your notebooks)
(Pro Tip: Go through your notebooks and note down all the import statements. Then, create a requirements.txt file listing all the libraries you've used. For example: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn.)

So, what are you waiting for? Dive in and become a Credit Risk Guru! 🎉
Before you deploy this:

Replace your-username and your-repo-name in the git clone command.

Crucially, create the requirements.txt file! Go through each of your .ipynb files and list all the Python libraries you imported. For example:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib

You might want to add a small section at the top of the README, perhaps under "What's Inside", with a very brief overview of the dataset (e.g., "This project utilizes a publicly available dataset from LendingClub, containing loan data from [start year] to [end year]."). This is optional, but can be helpful.
